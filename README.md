## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but MRGpsDataGetter does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding MRGpsDataGetter as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/furiosFast/MRBadgeDisplayCoordinator.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
